# Plus Addressing Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Services

**PlusAddressEmailService** (`/services/plusAddressEmailService.js`)
- Replaces subdomain-based routing with plus addressing
- Generates addresses like: `documents+{subdomain}-{prefix}@42consultingllc.com`
- Parses incoming plus addresses to extract subdomain and prefix
- Routes emails to correct instance and configuration

**EmailProcessorV2** (`/services/emailProcessorV2.js`)
- Updated to use PlusAddressEmailService instead of SubdomainEmailService
- Processes emails sent to plus addresses
- Maintains all existing functionality (duplicate detection, control number extraction, etc.)

### 2. Routes Updated

**Email Config Route** (`/routes/emailConfig.js`)
- `/setup-managed/:instanceId` endpoint now generates plus addresses
- Uses `plusAddressEmailService.generatePlusAddress()` instead of subdomain logic

### 3. Email Address Format

- **Old Format**: `{prefix}@{subdomain}.42consultingllc.com` (e.g., `docs@origintest.42consultingllc.com`)
- **New Format**: `documents+{subdomain}-{prefix}@42consultingllc.com` (e.g., `documents+origintest-docs@42consultingllc.com`)

### 4. Key Benefits

1. **No DNS Changes Required**: Works with existing Office 365 setup
2. **Single Mailbox**: All emails go to `documents@42consultingllc.com`
3. **Unlimited Addresses**: Create as many plus address variations as needed
4. **GoDaddy Compatible**: Works with GoDaddy-hosted Office 365

### 5. How It Works

1. User creates email configuration with a prefix (e.g., "docs")
2. System generates plus address: `documents+origintest-docs@42consultingllc.com`
3. User sends/forwards emails to this address with control number in subject
4. Office 365 delivers to `documents@42consultingllc.com` inbox
5. EmailProcessorV2 reads the inbox every 5 minutes
6. Parses the plus address to determine instance and configuration
7. Files documents to appropriate IMS instance

### 6. Testing the System

1. Create an email configuration in the UI
2. Note the generated plus address
3. Send a test email to that address with subject "ID:12345 Test Document"
4. Check email processing logs to verify routing

### 7. Next Steps for Production

1. Test with actual Office 365 account
2. Verify plus addressing is working
3. Update any documentation or user guides
4. Consider adding email rules in Office 365 for organization

## Office 365 Requirements

- Plus addressing must be enabled (default in Office 365)
- Application needs Mail.Read permission
- Access to `documents@42consultingllc.com` mailbox

## No Changes Needed From User

The user (David) doesn't need to make any Office 365 configuration changes. Plus addressing works out of the box with Office 365.
